# Milk-Quality-Prediction
Topic: Milk Quality Prediction using Machine Learning 
</br>
Dataset Description:
This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the quality of milk.
This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.
</br>
Target:
We have to perform data preprocessing, and data augmentation techniques to build statistical and predictive models to predict the quality of the milk.</br>

Inspiration:
To leverage the benefits of machine learning in the dairy industry.

ðŸ“ˆ Using XGBoost, I have developed a machine-learning model that can predict the quality of the milk with amazing accuracy.
